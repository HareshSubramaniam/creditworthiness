Credit Card Default Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a credit card holder will default on their payment in the next month using machine learning models. It uses customer financial data and applies both Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to evaluate credit risk.
🚀 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas – Data handling
Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Train/Test split, Scaling, Evaluation)

Generate classification reports, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC scores.
Make predictions for individual customers.
Final decision system:
If both models predict Good, output = ✅ YES for eligible.
output = ❌ NO.
